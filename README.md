# OP

this i a basic game i developed as part of the computer science organisation. The questions were not made by me that is why i have not added questions in the repository. 
this app has a mongoDB database with two seperate collections for questions and players, the players are added in data base when they type in their name on the start page. The questions need to be manually added to the dataBase as there is not admin page.




TO START THE GAME
players need to got to "/start" page to start playing 
players need to type in their names and they will be added to the data base.
players need to type the correct answers in the answer box of each question.


TO DECLARE WINNERS 
When multiple people are competing and multiple people are able to complete the game the one who takes the least time wins the game. 
This website records the timestamp as players pass each question hence it is easy to was the fastest to win
