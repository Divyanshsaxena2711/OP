# OP


the is a template website , for a game that was made by me as part of the Computer Science Association. since the questions were not made by me i have not put actual questions in the repository. 

To play go to 'Start ' page
The user need to type in their name and the click on start.
This leads to the rules, page,click on next .
After this, the questions will follow , try solving in the least time possible.


To win the game.
Whoever finishes the game in the keast time wins the game. 
in case players are unable to finish the game, the person who could solve the most questions in least time is declared winner.
